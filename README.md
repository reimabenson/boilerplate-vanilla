A modern, high-performance Shopify theme boilerplate based on the Dawn theme. This project is designed for maintainable and scalable Shopify theme development with:

- **Dawn as base** — latest Shopify Online Store 2.0 features
- **Vite** — optimized JS/CSS bundling with fast build times
- **GSAP** — smooth animations
- **pnpm** — fast dependency management
- **shopify.theme.toml** — environment configuration
- **CSS/JS optimization** — production-ready builds
- **Tailwind CSS** — utility-first styling (Optional)
- **Vue.js (or Vanilla/Alpine options)** — optional reactive components (Optional)
